this is what our ai did for us:

I need to map a pointer in a gauss bell but having just a value ex: 44. The pointer willl be mapped based on the following ranges: [(0, 57), (57, 73), (73,101)] . I need to know the coordinates of that pointer to be able to put it along the curve.
Based on the given range, the coordinate for the value of 44 can be calculated as follows:

If the value is less than or equal to 57, the coordinate will be (0, 44/57).
If the value is greater than 57 but less than or equal to 73, the coordinate will be ((44-57)/(73-57), 1).
If the value is greater than 73, the coordinate will be (1, (101-44)/(101-73)).
Note: The above calculations assume that the Gaussian bell curve is normalized and that the x-axis ranges from 0 to 1 and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 1.

the x-axis ranges are 0 to 100 and the y-axis 0 to 1
Understood. Based on the given range, the coordinate for the value of 44 can be calculated as follows:

If the value is less than or equal to 57, the coordinate will be (0, 44/57).
If the value is greater than 57 but less than or equal to 73, the coordinate will be (57 + (44-57)/(73-57)_(73-57), 1).
If the value is greater than 73, the coordinate will be (73 + (101-44)/(101-73)_(100-73), (101-44)/(101-73)).
Note: The above calculations assume that the Gaussian bell curve is normalized, meaning the highest point of the curve is at y=1, and that the y-axis ranges from 0 to 1.

the mean of the curve is 64.58 and the standard deviation is 10.59
The Gaussian bell curve can be defined as:

f(x) = exp(-0.5 _ ((x - mean) / standard deviation)^2) / (standard deviation _ sqrt(2 \* pi))

Where "mean" is the mean value of the curve, "standard deviation" is the standard deviation of the curve, and "pi" is the mathematical constant pi (approximately equal to 3.14).

So for a mean of 64.58 and a standard deviation of 10.59, the coordinate for the value of 44 can be calculated as follows:

f(44) = exp(-0.5 _ ((44 - 64.58) / 10.59)^2) / (10.59 _ sqrt(2 \* pi))

Note: The above formula returns the height of the curve at the given x value, which can be used to determine the y coordinate of the pointer.
